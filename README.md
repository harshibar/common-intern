## Inspiration
Ever sit at your desk for hours, clicking through endless job listings hoping to strike gold with one response? To solve this, I made a script a few months ago, which would take in a list of job URLs and automatically apply to potentially 100s of jobs with the click of a button. This was great, but there was one problem ‚Äî the process of aggregating those links is painstaking. So, I wanted to automate that process with this project! ‚ú®

## Installation
1. Install [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) (or an alternatie driver for your browser of choice):
   * Run `brew cask install chromedriver`
   * Confirm installation: `chromedriver --version`
   * Check location of ChromeDriver: `which chromedriver`
   * Wherever the `driver` is initialized in the code, insert the ChromeDriver location
2. Install Selenium: `pip install selenium`
3. Install BeautifulSoup: `pip install beautifulsoup4`

### Windows
1. Install Python 64-bit
2. Add Python scripts to PATH Environment Variable
3. Install pip (pip will let you know what to add to PATH)
4. Download [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/86.0.4240.22/chromedriver_win32.zip) for Windows
5. Extract ChromeDriver to `C:\Windows` to make it available everywhere
6. Remove ChromeDriver location where `driver` is initialized in the code.
7. Install Selenium: `pip install selenium`
8. Install BeautifulSoup: `pip install beautifulsoup4`

## Usage
#### To test `get_links.py`
1. Uncomment the last line `get_links.py`
2. Run `$ python get_links.py`

#### To run the entire script:
1. Set a number of pages you'd like to iterate through here
2. Run `$ python apply.py`
3. The script will open [glassdoor.com](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm), at which point you should log-in
4. From there on, everything is automatic!


## Thanks

* [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) - A tool designed for QA testing, but that actually works great for making these types of bots
* [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/doc) - A tool to scrape HTML/XML content (that saved be *big time* with this project)
